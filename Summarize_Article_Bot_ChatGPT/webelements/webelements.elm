While the new tool might provide another reference point, Ahmad said “teachers need to be really careful in how they include it in academic dishonesty decisions.”\n  \n\n  \n      Since it was made available in late November, ChatGPT has been used to generate original essays, stories and song lyrics in response to user prompts.

Public schools in New York City and Seattle have already banned students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district’s networks and devices.

Some companies such as Turnitin are actively working on ChatGPT plagiarism detection tools that could help teachers identify when assignments are written by the tool.

People can edit text to avoid being identified by the tool, for example. It will also “be best at identifying text that is very similar to the kind of text that we’ve trained it on.”\n  \n\n  \n      In addition, the company said it’s impossible to determine if predictable text – such as a list of the first 1,000 prime numbers – was written by AI or a human because the correct answer is always the same, according to a company blog post. The classifier is also “very unreliable” on short texts below 1,000 characters.\n  \n\n  \n      \n            \n        \n      \n    \n       \n       \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        Adobe Stock\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      Teachers are adapting to concerns about a powerful new AI tool \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n  \n      During a demo with CNN ahead of Tuesday’s launch, ChatGPT successfully labeled several bodies of work.
