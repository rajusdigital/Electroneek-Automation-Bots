This article covers the discovery of an unusual star system 11,000 light-years away from Earth by researchers. It explains how the two stars, a larger one and a smaller one, were whirling around one another in a very close orbit, leading to the smaller star growing from 8 or 9 times the mass of our sun to 18 or 19 times the mass of our sun. The star system's explosion was a "ultra-stripped" and "lackluster" one,

This article is about a study that has found that Neanderthals hunted and systematically butchered Palaeoloxodon antiquus, the largest land mammal of the Pleistocene, for their meat. The study also suggests that Neanderthals were extremely skilled hunters, knew how to preserve meat, and lived in larger groups than previously thought. It also emphasizes that Neanderthals were not brutish cave dwellers, but rather skilled hunters with preservation technologies and other human-like traits.

The study suggests that Neanderthals hunted these animals, dismembered them for their meat, fat and brains, and knew how to preserve and store the meat. The findings of this study show that Neanderthals were highly skilled hunters, living in larger groups than previously thought, and had advanced preservation techniques. It also challenges the
